Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson (born 15 April 1990) is an English 
actress and model. She rose to prominence playing Hermione Granger 
in the Harry Potter film series; she was cast as Hermione at the 
age of nine, having previously acted only in school plays.
She starred in all eight Harry Potter films, alongside Daniel 
Radcliffe and Rupert Grint. Watson's work on the Harry Potter 
series has earned her several awards and more than £10 million.
She made her modelling debut for Burberry's autumn/winter campaign 
in 2009. In October 2013, she was voted Sexiest Female Movie Star 
in a worldwide poll conducted by Empire magazine. In May 2014, 
BuzzFeed dubbed her the "most flawless woman of the decade".
In 2007, Watson announced her involvement in The Tale of Despereaux 
and the television adaptation of the novel Ballet Shoes, 
which was broadcast on 26 December 2007 to an audience of 5.2 million. 
The Tale of Despereaux, based on the novel by Kate DiCamillo, 
was released in 2008 and grossed more than US$86 million in 
worldwide sales. In 2012, she starred in Stephen Chbosky's 
film adaptation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and in 2014, 
she played Ila in Darren Aronofsky's biblical epic Noah.
Watson was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador in 2014. 
She helped launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, 
which calls for men to advocate for "gender equality".`

Watson was born in Paris, the daughter of English lawyers Jacqueline 
Luesby and Chris Watson. Watson lived in Paris until the age of five. 
Her parents separated when she was young; following their divorce, 
Watson moved back to England to live with her mother in Oxfordshire 
while spending weekends at her father's house in London. Watson has 
stated that she speaks some French, though "not as well" as she used to.
After moving to Oxford with her mother and brother, Watson attended the 
Dragon School in Oxford, remaining there until 2003. From the age of six, 
she wanted to become an actress, and trained at the Oxford branch of 
Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied 
singing, dancing, and acting. By the age of ten, she had performed 
in various Stagecoach productions and school plays, including Arthur: 
The Young Years and The Happy Prince,[19] but she had never acted 
professionally before the Harry Potter series. Following the Dragon 
School, Watson moved on to Headington School.[12] While on film sets, 
she and her peers were tutored for up to five hours a day. In June 2006, 
she took GCSE school examinations in ten subjects, achieving eight
 A* and two A grades.`

In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone 
(released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States), 
the film adaptation of British author J. K. Rowling's best-selling novel. 
Casting agents found Watson through her Oxford theatre teacher, 
and producers were impressed by her confidence. After eight auditions, 
producer David Heyman told Watson and fellow applicants Daniel Radcliffe 
and Rupert Grint that they had been cast for the roles of the schoolfriends 
Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley respectively. Rowling supported 
Watson from her first screen test.
The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 2001 was Watson's 
debut screen performance. The film broke records for opening-day sales and 
opening-weekend takings and was the highest-grossing film of 2001. Critics praised 
the performances of the three leads, often singling out Watson for particular 
acclaim; The Daily Telegraph called her performance "admirable", and IGN said she 
"stole the show". Watson was nominated for five awards for her performance in 
Philosopher's Stone, winning the Young Artist Award for Leading Young Actress.`

A year later, Watson again starred as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Chamber of 
Secrets, the second instalment of the series. Reviewers praised the lead actors' 
performances. The Los Angeles Times said Watson and her peers had matured between 
films, while The Times criticised director Chris Columbus for "under-employing" 
Watson's hugely popular character. Watson received an Otto Award from the German 
magazine Bravo for her performance.`

In 2004, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released. Watson was 
appreciative of the more assertive role Hermione played, calling her character 
"charismatic" and "a fantastic role to play".[30] Although critics panned Radcliffe's 
performance, labelling him "wooden", they praised Watson; The New York Times lauded 
her performance, saying "Luckily Mr. Radcliffe's blandness is offset by Ms. Watson's 
spiky impatience. Harry may show off his expanding wizardly skills ... but Hermione 
... earns the loudest applause with a decidedly unmagical punch to Draco Malfoy's 
deserving nose."[31] Although Prisoner of Azkaban proved to be the lowest-grossing 
Harry Potter film of the entire series, Watson's personal performance won her two Otto 
Awards and the Child Performance of the Year award from Total Film.`

With Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), both Watson and the Harry Potter 
film series reached new milestones. The film set records for a Harry Potter opening 
weekend, a non-May opening weekend in the US, and an opening weekend in the UK. 
Critics praised the increasing maturity of Watson and her teenage co-stars; 
The New York Times called her performance "touchingly earnest". For Watson, 
much of the humour of the film sprang from the tension among the three lead 
characters as they matured. She said, "I loved all the arguing. ... I think 
it's much more realistic that they would argue and that there would be problems.
"Nominated for three awards for Goblet of Fire, Watson won a bronze Otto Award.
Later that year, Watson became the youngest person to appear on the cover of Teen 
Vogue, an appearance she reprised in August 2009. In 2006, Watson played Hermione 
in The Queen's Handbag, a special mini-episode of Harry Potter in celebration of 
Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday.`
